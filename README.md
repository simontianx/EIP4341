# ERC4341 Logographic NFT Standard
A vanilla non-fungible token standard proposed by EIP-3754 together with the established unicode system can create an on-chain language system particularly valuable for representing language characters that are logographs. Examples include hanzi in Mandarin, kanji in Japanese, hanja in Korean, and etc. On-chain chatting, blogs, micro-blogs systems can be built for communities using such languages.
