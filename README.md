# EIP-4341 Ordered NFT Batch Standard
This standard introduces a smart contract interface that can represent a batch
of non-fungible tokens of which the ordering information shall be retained and
managed. Such information is particularly useful if `tokenId`s are encoded with
the sets of `unicode`s for logographic characters and emojis. As a result, NFTs
can be utilized as carriers of meanings.

This standard has been officially merged [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4341).
