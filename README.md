# ERC4341 Unicoded NFT Standard
Simple on-chain communication between any two EOAs is made possible by transferring [EIP-3754](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-3754.md) NFTs with unicoded tokenIds in a batch as proposed in this standard. This is particularly efficient and useful for emojis and languages that are based on **[logographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram)**. Examples include _hanzi_ in Mandarin, _kanji_ in Japanese, _hanja_ in Korean, and etc. Many more applications are opened up for speakers of these languages as by-products.
